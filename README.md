## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.com](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.com).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This%20starter%20configures%20Supabase%20Auth%20to%20use%20cookies%2C%20making%20the%20user's%20session%20available%20throughout%20the%20entire%20Next.js%20app%20-%20Client%20Components%2C%20Server%20Components%2C%20Route%20Handlers%2C%20Server%20Actions%20and%20Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png&integration-ids=oac_VqOgBHqhEoFTPzGkPd7L0iH6)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#how-to-use).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app -e with-supabase
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd name-of-new-app
   ```

4. Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.

## How to use

There are a variety of example files for you to copy and build your app with in the starter kit.

### Create a Supabase client

Check out the [`/app/_examples`](./app/_examples/) folder for an example of creating a Supabase client in:

- [Client Components](./app/_examples/client-component/page.tsx)
- [Server Components](./app/_examples/server-component/page.tsx)
- [Route Handlers](./app/_examples/route-handler/route.ts)
- [Server Actions](./app/_examples/server-action/page.tsx)

### Create `todo` table and seed with data (optional)

Navigate to [your project's SQL Editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/sql), click `New query`, paste the contents of the [init.sql](./supabase/migrations/20230618024722_init.sql) file and click `RUN`.

This will create a basic `todos` table, enable Row Level Security (RLS), and write RLS policies enabling `select` and `insert` actions for `authenticated` users.

To seed your `todos` table with some dummy data, run the contents of the [seed.sql](./supabase/seed.sql) file.

## Feedback and issues

Please file feedback and issues over on the [Supabase GitHub org](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/new/choose).
